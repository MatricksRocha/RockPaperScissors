## 📕 About

This website was created as a study challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). Basically, this is a website where the user can play Rock Paper Scissors.

My main objective with this challenge was to improve even more my JavaScript skills in a real project and also keep improving my HTML and CSS skills.
